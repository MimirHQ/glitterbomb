# Glitter Bomb

Practice Python syntax by unraveling virtual glitter bombs and learning how to disarm them.

## Try It

You can play some sample glitter bombs [at this link](https://repl.it/@vingkan/glitterbombpython) (no account creation required).

## Learning Objectives

- Understand common Python syntax.
- Evaluate Python programs in your head while reading source code.
- Write Python programs where user input affects control flow.

## Instructions

Every glitter bomb is a Python script. When you run the script, follow the instructions in the system console to try and disarm the bomb. Try playing each glitter bomb a few times without looking at the code, then read the insides and figure out how it works.

## Contributions

If you create a bomb that you want to share with the community, you can [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) and add it to this repository in the `community` folder. Community glitter bombs must meet these requirements:

- [x] Can be used by any teachers or learners for free
- [x] Uses a filename that is not already taken
- [x] Includes the author's name, screen name, website link, or other means through which they want to be credited
- [x] (Preferably) Is contained within a single file, with minimal public package dependencies

If this is your first time creating a pull request or you have other questions, feel free to contact oer@mimirhq.com

## About

This project is, in part, inspired by [the Binary Bomb Lab](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/labs.html) by Bryant and O'Hallaron from Carnegie Mellon University. These projects are not affiliated.

Glitter Bomb is maintained by the curriculum team at [Mimir](https://www.mimirhq.com/), a company that helps high schools and universities teach computer science classes and give their students helpful feedback on their work.
